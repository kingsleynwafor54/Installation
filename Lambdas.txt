Looping through  a collection of object using lambdas in java


Java is majorly an object oriented programming language.The importance of lambdas as a programmer is to
make you code appear shorter,efficient and above all functional.Everything in java is an object. An object could be physical or imaginary,it 
just have to do with the way we see thing or thing about things in general. For example an wallet is an object that has a method to keep money,keep cards etc 
example 2; a bucket is an object that has method to store fluids either solid,liquid or gas depending on what you want to store it with.
Now it get interesting when you have a collection of wallets with different items in it and you want to access the one with the red id-card that has money more
than #30,000(# is naria in nigeria currency),this is when lambdas comes in.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using lambdas is an effective way of writing you codes as some programmers argue that it might not be clear enough but the truth is , it is highly efficient
and leaves room for  no error in your code. It abstracts all the pipe-line you have to create to find what you are looking for,let use our wallet object as
a case study :you will have to create different groups of wallets based on color first before you create another group based on the out come of the first group
with money greater than #30,000.Let's code it>>>>
```
package Lambda_Collection;

public enum Card {
    Red,Black,Green,Blue
}
```

```

package Lambda_Collection;

import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

public class Wallet {

        private double money;
     
    private Card card;//card is a variable of Card object and this phenomenon is called Composition.
        int counter=0;
    public Wallet(double money,  Card card ) {
        this.money = money;
        addCards(card);

    }
//creating methods that stores money and Card

        public void storeMoney(double money){
            this.money+=money;
        }
        public double takeMoney(){
            return money;
        }

        public void addCards(Card card){
            this.card=card;
            counter++;


        }
        public Card getCards(){
            return card;
        }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return  String.format("%s%.2f %s ",
                 "#",takeMoney(), getCards());
         }


```

First you create a general folder or package for writing all you codes, firstly we created an object of card because java is an object oriented language ,
now we have seen how a wallet looks like on code,you can set the money and that is you adding money to your wallet. The toString method is to make your
visible.



Below  is the code base of how we are going to look like when we use lambdas to display,manipulate through
```
package Lambda_Collection;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

public class Collection_Wallet {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
           Wallet[] walletsGroups={
                new Wallet(4000,Card.Blue),
                new Wallet(14000,Card.Black),
                new Wallet(34000,Card.Red),
                new Wallet(24000,Card.Red),
                new Wallet(44000,Card.Green),
                new Wallet(44000,Card.Black),
                new Wallet(44000,Card.Green),
                new Wallet(54000,Card.Black),
                new Wallet(34000,Card.Blue),
                new Wallet(74000,Card.Black),
                new Wallet(64000,Card.Black),
        };


      // The above is a collection of wallet object,after this we then save it as list
        List<Wallet> list = Arrays.asList(walletsGroups);


        System.out.println("Completes Display Of Wallets");
//this is use to   display the collections using lambdas
       list.stream().forEach(System.out::println);



    }
}
N/B that list.stream() creates a stream of Wallet just as we said early you spread your wallets all over the table and them you want to look for a specific
thing.

Filtering Wallet: when you are searching for a card that is green we place them in an array i.e have a collection of wallet and then we iterate through
 Two major interfaces that will help you to manipulate your collections using lambdas are the Functions<T,R> and the Predicate<T>
The Predicate takes in an arguement and returns true or false ,this is use to check whether a particular  parameter meets the condition while Function takes
in parameter and also return required datatype
Customers<T> takes in arguement and return void such as the forEach
Supplier<T>etc takes in no arguement and return a value of T

Firstly we use the Predicate interface to iterate through the collection of object

Predicate<T> this takes an arguement and them returns true or false which validates ,it is then use with the filter which is an intermediate method that 
takes in a predicate method

N/B please write this codes in your Collection_Wallet class;
Example1
Selection Base on Card and Amount and then sorting
-------------------------------------------------
```
Predicate<Wallet> takeMoneyAndBlackCard=
                e -> (e.takeMoney() >= 30000 && e.getCards().equals(Card.Black));
        System.out.printf("%n Display of your sorted list: %n");
        list.stream()
                .filter(takeMoneyAndBlackCard)
                .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Wallet::getCards))
                .forEach(System.out::println);
```
The Comparator interface with it static method comparing ,compares two object of wallet base on it instance method and return negative if the first is greater
than the second ,positive if the first is greater and zero if they are equal ,then the forEach terminates the entire pipeline.

Result
```
Display of your sorted list by Card: 
#44000.00 Black 
#54000.00 Black 
#74000.00 Black 
#64000.00 Black 

```
Example2
Predicate<Wallet> takeMoneyAndBlackCard=
                e -> (e.takeMoney() >= 30000 && e.getCards().equals(Card.Black));
        System.out.printf("%n Display of your sorted list: %n");
        list.stream()
                .filter(takeMoneyAndBlackCard)
                .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Wallet::takeMoney))
                .forEach(System.out::println);

Result
Display of your sorted list money: 
#44000.00 Black 
#54000.00 Black 
#64000.00 Black 
#74000.00 Black 

What if we want to find the wallet with money higher than #30000 ? We will use the find first intermediate method

 Predicate<Wallet> takeMoneyAndBlackCard=
                e -> (e.takeMoney() >= 30000 );
        System.out.printf("%n Display of your sorted list: %n");
        System.out.println( list.stream()
                .filter(takeMoneyAndBlackCard)
                .findFirst())
		.get();
Result
#34000.00 Red

N/B if you are writing this codes make sure that everytime you use an Predicate interface always use a different variable

Function<T,R>
```
        Function<Wallet, Double> byTakeMoney = Wallet::takeMoney;
        Function<Wallet, Card> byGetCard = Wallet::getCards;


        Comparator<Wallet> byMoneyThenByCard=Comparator.comparing(byTakeMoney).thenComparing(byGetCard);

        System.out.println("Display by money then by card");
        list.stream()
                .sorted(byMoneyThenByCard)
                .forEach(System.out::println);

```

Result
 Display of your sorted list: 
#34000.00 Red 
Display by money then by card
#4000.00 Blue 
#14000.00 Black 
#24000.00 Red 
#34000.00 Red 
#34000.00 Blue 
#44000.00 Black 
#44000.00 Green 
#44000.00 Green 
#54000.00 Black 
#64000.00 Black 
#74000.00 Black 

We will see how to reverse base on values in the collection using lambdas
```System.out.println("Display by money then by card in reserve order)
        list.stream()
                .sorted(byMoneyThenByCard.reversed())
                .forEach(System.out::println);`

```
Result
Display by money then by card
#74000.00 Black 
#64000.00 Black 
#54000.00 Black 
#44000.00 Green 
#44000.00 Green 
#44000.00 Black 
#34000.00 Blue 
#34000.00 Red 
#24000.00 Red 
#14000.00 Black 
#4000.00 Blue 

Grouping

Mapping Wallet to unique Color of card on display
```
       System.out.println("Printing out distinctive amount in the wallet");
list.stream()
        .map(Wallet::takeMoney)
        .distinct()
        .sorted()
        .forEach(System.out::println);

        System.out.println("Printing out distinctive card in the wallet");
        list.stream()
                .map(Wallet::getCards)
                .distinct()
                .sorted()
                .forEach(System.out::println);

```
Result
Printing out distinctive amount in the wallet
4000.0
14000.0
24000.0
34000.0
44000.0
54000.0
64000.0
74000.0
Printing out distinctive card in the wallet
Red
Black
Green
Blue

Grouping Of Object based on the given instance methods and how the vary in categorising,you will use lambda static methods collect, the collect arguement
is a collector that specifies how to summarize the date in a meaningful manner.Map takes in two arguement telling the jvm(java virtual machine) that
"I want to map a card object to a long object,the counting() static method of the collectors returns long(Long is an object or a type wrapper of long),
then we print the outcome by calling the variable in a chain method call to the forEach terminal method that displays the outcome.
```
   Map<Card, Long> walletCountByCard =
                list.stream()
                        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Wallet::getCards,Collectors.counting()));
                        walletCountByCard.forEach(
                 (getCards, count) -> System.out.printf(
                "%s has %d wallet(s)%n", getCards, count));

    }
```
Result
Blue has 2 wallet(s)
Red has 2 wallet(s)
Green has 2 wallet(s)
Black has 5 wallet(s)
 
Calculation the sum of all the amount the all the wallet
System.out.printf(
                 "%nSum of Wallet' salaries (via sum method): %.2f%n",
                 list.stream()
                .mapToDouble(Wallet::takeMoney)
                .sum());

Result
Sum of Wallet' money (via sum method): 434000.00

Average of Wallet' money (via average method): 39454.55
Calculating for specific color of cards
 Predicate<Wallet> takeMoneyAndBlackCard1=
                e -> (e.getCards().equals(Card.Black) );
        System.out.printf(
                "%nSum of Black Card wallet(via average method): %.2f%n",
                list.stream()
                        .filter(takeMoneyAndBlackCard1)
                        .mapToDouble(Wallet::takeMoney)
                        .sum());
Note that I used Predicate interface and also embeded it inside the filter method
Result

Sum of Black Card wallet(via average method): 250000.00
